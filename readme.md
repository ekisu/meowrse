# translateMeow

translateMeow is a script that converts cat code into morse code and vice versa, such that a meow represents a dot (".") and a rawr represents a dash ("-"). For example:

`meowmeowmeowmeow meow meowrawrmeowmeow meowrawrmeowmeow rawrrawrrawr / meowrawrrawr rawrrawrrawr meowrawrmeow meowrawrmeowmeow rawrmeowmeow rawrmeowrawrmeowrawrrawr`

translates to "hello world"!


We are accepting contributions to the project, as it's relatively complex and extremely time demanding.

## Build
`gcc translateMeow.c -o translateMeow`
